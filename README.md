# PyBer_Analysis
## Module 5
### Overview of the Analysis
#### This analysis is to summarize the ride-sharing data by city type to help PyBer make more strategic decisions to make more money. We created a graph to show the total weekly fares for each city type. By doing this, we can summarize how the data differs in different cities. 
### Results
#### Looking at the chart below we can see that urban communities are vastly growing within rideshare having the highest number of total rides, drivers, and fares. This has decreased the average fare per ride and the average fare per driver. In rural communities where total rides, total drivers, and total fares are at the lowest, the average fare per ride and the average fare per driver increase. This follows the law of demand between total rides/total drivers and average fare per ride/average fare per driver.

### Summary
#### Considering a vast majority of rides are in urban areas, it would be wise to increase the fair by possibly setting a base fair in major cities.
#### Due to the high prices and low demand in rural areas, consider implementing discounting to make fares more affordable to encourage residents to use the ridesharing app
#### Encourage drivers to go to rural areas, as the average fair price is so high to make more money.
